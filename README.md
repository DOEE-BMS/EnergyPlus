## Files
- [DOEE-EnergyPlus V0.1.1](/DOEE-EnergyPlus V0.1.1): EnergyPlus IDF file. ([MARLISA](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344502330_MARLISA_Multi-Agent_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Iterative_Sequential_Action_Selection_for_Load_Shaping_of_Grid-Interactive_Connected_Buildings)), which is based on the single-agent RL algorithm [SAC](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05905). The agents are implemented for a district with 9 different buildings in ```DOEE-BMS```
